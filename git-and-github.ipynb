    "Version control is a system that records changes made to a file or set of files over time so that specific versions can be retrieved later. For the examples in this notebook, we will use the source code of the software as the files that are version controlled, although in reality you can do this with almost any type of file on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're a web or graphic designer and you want to keep all versions of an image or design (which you certainly will), a version control system (VCS) is a very smart thing to do. It allows you to revert selected files to a previous state, revert the entire project to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who was the last to modify something that might be causing a problem, who introduced a problem and when, and much more. Using a VCS also generally means that if things mess up or files are lost, it can be easily recovered. In addition, all this is achieved with very little expense.\n",
    "\n",
    "GIT is a VCS system designed with the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "* speed\n",
    "* Simple design\n",
    "* Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)\n",
    "* Fully distributed #entire copy\n",
    "* Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)\n",
    "\n",
    "**It's an absolute industry standard**\n",

    "* **Acyclic** means that the graph does not contain circles. This means that you cannot find a path that starts and ends at the same node following the direction of the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Directed** means that edges can only go in one direction. Think for example of \"father\", \"son\", and the relationship \"is son of\" --- no, you can't be father and son of the same person.\n",

    "## Terminology\n",
    "- `repository` | `repo` : storage location of a software package (\"a git-tracked folder\")\n",
    "- `untracked` : a file or directory not tracked by git, does not belong to the repository, but can be inside the folder.\n",
    "- `tracked` : a file that git has ordered to track (via the `add` command.)\n",
    "- `commit` : a point in the timeline of a repository. A \"snapshot\" of all the changes that we have \"officialized\", or the last state of the files scanned before committing.\n",
    "Each commit has a unique identifier and must have a commit message. The more descriptive the message, the better.\n",
    "- `local repo` : A code repository on the computer you are currently using.\n",
    "- `remote` : A repository on a different machine (for example: Github).\n",
    "- `forking a repo` : create an alternate timeline for a repo, usually someone else's repo that we want to have as a copy of our own.\n",
    "- `cloning a repo` : make a local copy of a remote repo.\n",
    "- `push` : Push changes from local to remote repository.\n",
    "- `pull` : pull changes from a remote repository to a local one.\n",
    "- `.gitignore` : text file with the files/folders we don't want git to track or query.\n",
    "    - e.g.:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        logo.jpg `# git ignore file with specific name`\n",

    "        develop_test/ `# git ignores the specified named directory and all its contents. Note the / after the name.`\n",
    "\n",
    "        *.jpg `# git ignores all files with a given extension`\n",
    "- `branch` : the different `timelines` of a repository. Allows parallel development.\n",
    "- `merge` : Merge changes from one branch to another. It is the opposite of branching, instead of separating, it joins two \"timelines\".\n",
    "- `pull request` : the act of asking the owner of a repository to merge changes into their fork/branch. It is literally the request that you `pull` your changes."
