    "## What is OOP - Object Oriented Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm, a style and technique for software development that extends beyond mere code implementation. This paradigm is centered on the concept of \"objects,\" which serve as self-contained units containing both data (referred to as \"attributes\") and code for manipulating that data (referred to as \"methods\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of OOP lies in encapsulating these attributes and methods within a unified data structure known as a \"class.\" Think of classes as blueprints that define the structure and behavior of objects, much like a cookie cutter defines the shape of cookies.\n",
    "\n",
    "When objects are instantiated from a class, they share a common structure and specific attributes, similar to cookies created from the same cookie cutter mold. However, just as each cookie can have its unique properties like color, texture, or flavor, objects can possess distinct attributes and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, OOP promotes modularity and code reusability by enabling developers to create and manipulate objects based on predefined classes. This approach has a profound impact on software engineering and forms the basis of various software development methodologies."

   },
   "source": [
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is built on four fundamental principles that help structure and organize code in a more intuitive and modular way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Abstraction**: Human thinking naturally abstracts concrete information into broader concepts or classes. For example, when we think of a \"car,\" we envision a vehicle with specific characteristics like four wheels, a steering wheel, and an engine. This ability to abstract concepts is crucial for language development and is mirrored in programming as well. In OOP, we refer to the abstract concept as a \"class\" and its concrete realizations as \"objects\" or \"instances.\" Your specific car is an object, an instance of the broader \"car\" class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encapsulation**:Each object in OOP contains its own data (attributes) and can be manipulated through specific actions (methods). For example, a car object might have attributes like tire pressure, color, and fuel level. These attributes are encapsulated within the object, meaning they are accessible and modifiable only through that object. This encapsulation ensures that data is self-contained, reducing the need for separate lists or variables to store related information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows one class to specialize or derive from another. The specialized class inherits properties and behaviors from a more general class, known as the \"superclass.\" For instance, \"Car\" and \"Truck\" classes can inherit from the \"Vehicle\" superclass. This approach promotes code reuse by inheriting common attributes and methods from a superior class. Python even supports \"multiple inheritance,\" enabling a class to inherit from multiple parent classes simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**:Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This is achieved by defining methods in the superclass and allowing subclasses to override those methods with their own implementations. For example, both \"Square\" and \"Circle\" classes may be subclasses of \"Shape,\" and all of them implement a common method like \"draw().\" When you call this method on an object, the specific subclass's implementation is executed. This flexibility allows functions to accept objects of the superclass as parameters, not needing to know the exact subclass, promoting code reusability and adaptability.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four principles collectively form the foundation of OOP, enabling more organized, modular, and flexible code development.\n"

    "## Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Imperative Programming:\n",
    "    - **Imperative programming** is a paradigm that focuses on describing how a program operates step by step.\n",
    "    - It emphasizes changing program state through a series of statements or commands.\n",
    "    - Key characteristics include variables, loops, conditionals, and explicit state changes.\n",
    "    - Programs written in this paradigm are often easy to understand sequentially but can become complex with increasing size and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Functional Programming:\n",
    "    - **Functional programming** is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.\n",
    "    - It emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and declarative expressions.\n",
    "    - Key characteristics include higher-order functions, first-class functions, and the absence of side effects.\n",
    "    - Functional programs are often concise, maintainable, and easier to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
    "    - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit.\n",
    "    - It emphasizes modeling real-world entities and their interactions in code.\n",
    "    - Key characteristics include classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.\n",
    "    - OOP promotes modularity, reusability, and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional vs. OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Management**:\n",
    "    - Functional programming typically avoids mutable state and encourages immutability, making it easier to reason about code. In contrast, OOP often involves changing object states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Structures**:\n",
    "    - Functional programming relies on built-in data structures and functions, while OOP defines custom classes to represent data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Abstraction**:\n",
    "    - OOP focuses on modeling real-world objects with classes, promoting a natural abstraction. Functional programming abstracts through functions and transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Inheritance**:\n",
    "    - OOP uses inheritance to define relationships between classes. Functional programming relies on composition and higher-order functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Side Effects**:\n",
    "    - Functional programming discourages side effects and promotes pure functions. OOP may involve side effects through method calls and state changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Modularity**:\n",
    "    - Both paradigms support modularity but achieve it differently. OOP uses classes and objects, while functional programming relies on function composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Complexity**:\n",
    "    - Functional programming often results in more concise and less complex code due to immutability and purity. OOP code can become complex with deep inheritance hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, functional programming and OOP are distinct paradigms with different philosophies and trade-offs. Functional programming prioritizes immutability, pure functions, and declarative expressions, while OOP focuses on modeling real-world entities using classes and objects. The choice between them depends on the problem domain and design goals of a software project."

    "In Python classes, the `self` keyword plays a crucial role. It refers to the instance of the class itself and is used to access its attributes and methods. While it might seem like an extra requirement compared to some other programming languages, understanding and using `self` correctly is fundamental to writing effective and maintainable object-oriented Python code.\n",

    "To maintain consistency and adhere to Python's naming conventions, you can refer to resources like the Python PEP 8, [here](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/#naming-styles), style guide, which provides guidelines for naming variables, classes, functions, and more.

    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows you to define new classes based on existing ones. In this relationship, the existing class is referred to as the \"parent class,\" \"superclass,\" or \"parent,\" while the new class is known as the \"child class\" or \"subclass.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind inheritance is that a child class inherits all the properties (attributes and methods) of its parent class. This inheritance mechanism provides several advantages, with code reusability being one of the most significant benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "By inheriting from a parent class, a child class can reuse the attributes and methods defined in the parent class, saving developers from rewriting the same code. This promotes a more efficient and organized approach to software development, as changes or updates can be made in one place (the parent class) and automatically applied to all child classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to inheriting attributes and methods, child classes have the flexibility to override or extend these inherited elements. This means that child classes can provide their own implementations of methods (method overriding) or introduce new attributes and methods specific to their requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, inheritance is a powerful concept that fosters code reusability, maintainability, and flexibility in object-oriented programming, allowing developers to build upon existing classes to create new ones with shared functionalities.\n"

    "- **Method Defined in the Parent Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a method is defined in the parent class but not in the child class, the child class inherits the method without any need for modification. This means that the method in the child class will work exactly the same way as it does in the parent class, and there is no requirement to override it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method Defined Only in Child Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, a method may be defined exclusively in the child class and not in the parent class. In this scenario, the method belongs solely to the child class, and there is no inheritance in the opposite direction. This approach allows the child class to have its unique behavior and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method Defined in Both Parent and Child Classes**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a method is defined in both the parent and child classes, the child class's implementation takes precedence. This means that the method defined in the child class will override the parent class's method. However, there is a way to utilize the original method defined in the parent class while extending it in the child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, Python provides the `super()` function, which allows you to call any method of the parent class from the child class. By invoking `super()`, you can access the parent class's method and add extra functionality or behavior to it in the child class. It's essential to ensure that you provide all the necessary attributes and parameters when calling the parent class's method via `super()`.\n",

    "  \n",
    "## The Power of 'self'\n",
    "\n",
    "- `self` is the object referring to itself, enabling access to its attributes and methods.\n",
