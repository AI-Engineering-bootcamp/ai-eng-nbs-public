      "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems or machines that are designed to perform tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI has seen major advances in recent years due to increased availability of data, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing power through techniques like parallel processing and neural networks.\n",

      "\n",
      "- AI systems have matched or surpassed human performance in specialized tasks like playing complex games (e.g. chess, Go), image classification, and speech recognition. However, matching comprehensive human intelligence across all domains remains an aspirational goal for AI researchers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- Machine learning, which refers to algorithms that automatically improve themselves through experience and data without explicit programming, has been one of the most promising and widely used AI techniques. Popular methods include deep learning neural networks and reinforcement learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "- AI adoption in the business world is accelerating and producing real value according to a study by MIT which found that over 70% of firms that adopted AI generated over $100 million in value. Key business uses include predictive analytics, language processing for customer service, and intelligent process automation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- However, AI also faces challenges around explainability, potential biases, and job displacement as the technology matches some human capabilities. Researchers are working to address these challenges through technical solutions as well as policy guidance.\n",

Typically people will point to it being yet another abstraction on top of an already very abstract library, that the syntax is confusing, against [the Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/), and requires too much effort to learn new (or uncommon) syntax.\n",
